<p>
     TIME: The evening before Christmas, 1900.<br><br></p>
<p>
     SCENE: The scene is laid in a negro cabin, the home of_ CANDACE_and_ MARY MCLEAN, _in eastern North
     Carolina.<br><br></p>
     
     <p>
          In the right corner of the room is a rough bed covered with a
          ragged counterpane. In the centre at the rear is an old bureau with
          a cracked mirror, to the left of it a door opening to the outside.
          In the left wall is a window with red curtains. A large chest
          stands near the front on this side, and above it hang the family
          clothes, several ragged dresses, an old bonnet, and a cape. <br>At the
          right, toward the front, is a fireplace, in which a small fire is
          burning. Above and at the sides of the fireplace hang several pots
          and pans, neatly arranged. Above these is a mantel, covered with a
          lambrequin of dingy red crape paper. On the mantel are bottles and
          a clock. A picture of "Daniel in the Lion's Den" hangs above the
          mantel. The walls are covered with newspapers, to which are pinned
          several illustrations clipped from popular magazines. A rough table
          is in the centre of the room.

          fingers. Suddenly she utters a low scream, putting her hands to her
          head and rocking to and fro. She grasps her stick and begins
          beating about her as if striking at something, crying out in a loud
          voice._<br></p></div>
